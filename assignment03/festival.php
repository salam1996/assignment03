	<h2>Chinese New Year</h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p><strong>Chinese New Year</strong>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-2">a]</a> is the Chinese festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar">Chinese calendar</a>. The festival is usually referred to as the <strong>Spring Festival</strong> in mainland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>,[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-3">b]</a> and is one of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year">Lunar New Years</a> in Asia. Observances traditionally take place from the evening preceding the first day of the year to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern_Festival">Lantern Festival</a>, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-4">2]</a> In 2019, the first day of the Chinese New Year was on <strong>Tuesday, 5 February</strong>, initiating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac)">Year of the Pig</a>.</p>


  

	<h3>History</h3>

 <p>In 1928, the ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> party in China decreed that Chinese New Year will fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition from the populace. In 1967 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should "Change Customs", have a "revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival", and since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they did not have holidays during Spring Festival day. The public celebrations were reinstated by the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform">Chinese economic reform</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-54">52]</a></p>


  

	<h3>Traditional Food</h3>

 <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_dinner">reunion dinner</a> (<em>nián yè fàn</em>) is held on New Year's Eve during which family members gather for a celebration. The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot">hot pot</a> as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sausage">Chinese sausage</a>) and seafood (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster">lobster</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone">abalone</a>) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (traditional Chinese: 魚; simplified Chinese: 鱼; pinyin: <em>yú</em>) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase "may there be <em>surpluses</em> every year" (traditional Chinese: 年年有餘; simplified Chinese: 年年有余; pinyin: <em>niánnián yǒu yú</em>) sounds the same as "let there be fish every year." </p>

  

	<h3>Myth & Origin</h3>

The festival was traditionally a time to honour <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities">deities</a> as well as ancestors.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-13">11]</a>Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-14">12]</a> and the evening preceding Chinese New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_dinner">reunion dinner</a>. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck.

	<h3>History</h3>

  <p>The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty">Shang dynasty</a> (c. 1600–1046 BCE).[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-siu-11">11]</a> Morris Berkowitz, who studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people">Hakka people</a> during the 1960s, theorizes that the harvest celebration originally began with worshiping mountain deities after the harvest was completed.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-yu-12">12]</a> For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue">Baiyue</a> peoples, the harvest time commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-vietnam-nguyen-3">3]</a> The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907 CE).[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2">2]</a> One legend explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang">Emperor Xuanzong of Tang</a> started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-siu-11">11]</a> The term <em>mid-autumn</em> (中秋) first appeared in <em>Rites of Zhou</em>, a written collection of rituals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Zhou_dynasty">Western Zhou dynasty</a> (1046–771 BCE).[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2">2]</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a> (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival so much that she would spend the period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging elaborate rituals.[[13]</p>

  

	<h3>Tradional Food</h3>

  <p>Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-18">18]</a></p>

  

	<h3>Myth & Origion</h3>

  <p>The myths associated with Chang'e explain the origin of moon worship during this day. One version of the story is as follows, as described in Lihui Yang's <em>Handbook of Chinese Mythology</em>:[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-handbook-14">14]</a></p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>In the ancient past, there was a hero named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houyi">Hou Yi</a> who was excellent at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Pang Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p><em>Handbook of Chinese Mythology</em> also describes an alternate common version of the myth:[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-handbook-14">14]</a></p>



	<h2>Dragon Boat Festival</h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>The <strong>Duanwu Festival</strong>, also often known as the <strong>Dragon Boat Festival</strong>, is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice">summer solstice</a>. It is also known as <strong>Zhongxiao Festival</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters">Chinese</a>: 忠孝節; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</a>: <em>Zhōngxiàojié</em>), commemorating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism#Loyalty">fealty</a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety">filial piety</a>. The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar">Chinese calendar</a>, which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the <strong>Double Fifth Festival</strong>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-1">1]</a>The Chinese calendar is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar">lunisolar</a>, so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>. In 2016, it occurred on 9 June; in 2017, on 30 May; and in 2018, on 18 June.</p>
  

	<h3>History</h3>

  <p>The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan">Qu Yuan</a> (c. 340–278 BC) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(Chinese)">ancient state</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)">Chu</a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period">Warring States period</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10">10]</a> A cadet member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_(surname)">Chu royal house</a>, Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_(state)">Qin</a>, Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10">10]</a> During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry">poetry</a>. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ying_(Chu)">Ying</a>, the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miluo_River">Miluo River</a>.</p>

<p>It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat_race">dragon boat races</a>. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_rice">sticky rice</a> into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of <em>zongzi</em>.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10">10]</a></p>

  

	<h3>Traditional Food</h3>

  <p>A notable part of celebrating Duanwu is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.</p>

<p>The reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (中). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as 中奖 (winning a prize).</p>
