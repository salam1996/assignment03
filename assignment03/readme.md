### New England Patriots

The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston region. The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is located 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown Boston, Massachusetts and 20 miles (32 km) northeast of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium. 

#### History

On November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice – and the one that Sullivan selected – was the "Boston Patriots," with "Patriots" referring to those colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the "Pat Patriot" logo.

### FC Barcelona

Futbol Club Barcelona, known simply as Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fouth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €690.4 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.

#### History

On 22 October 1899, Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.

### New York Yankees


The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the New York Mets of the National League. In the 1901 season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders.The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in 1913.

#### History

At the end of 1900, Ban Johnson, president of the American League—a minor league previously known as the Western League (1894–1899)—reorganized the league. He added teams in three East Coast cities, forming the American League (AL) as a major league in an attempt to challenge the National League (NL) for supremacy. Plans to add a team in New York City were blocked by the NL's New York Giants, who had enough political power in New York City to prevent the AL from establishing a team. Instead, a team was placed in Baltimore, Maryland, a city which the NL abandoned when it contracted from 12 to 8 teams in 1900.

## United States Marine Corps

<hr>

### USMC Infantry Units 

The Marine Corps Infantry units are the bread and butter, the "Main Effort" of the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Infantry is organized in multiple regiements, each regiment is subservient to one of three Marine Divisions (1st, 2nd, & 3rd). Within each regiments are multiple battalions, each of which contain companies which inturn contain platoons. The mission of Marine Corps infantrymen is to locate close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver, and repel enemy assault by fire and close combat. There are many different roles and occupational specialties that fall under infantry, but the most important is by far the riflemen, whose job is to engage with the enemy. 

#### Divisions

-1st MarDiv
-2nd MarDiv
-3rd MarDiv

<hr>

### USMC Division Reconaissance 

The Marine Corps Division Recon Marines are infantrymen with advanced training in parachuting, combatant diving, patrolling, stealth tactics, and close combat tactics. This special training is necessary for their specialized mission of conducting amhibious reconaissance, special reconaissance, target aquisition, terminal guidance, and limited scale offensive raids. Divison Recon is organized in three battalions that are in turn owned by one of the three MarDivs. For example, 1st Recon Battalion belongs to 1st MarDiv. Marine Recon is are essentially infantrymen that have gone through a tough crucible and received advanced training that allows them to conduct uncovnetional operations. 

#### Divisions

-1st Recon Battalion
-2nd Recon Battalion 
-3rd Recon Battalion 

<hr>

### USMC Force Reconaissance 

The Force Reconaissance units in the Marine Corps are an even more specialized version of the Divison Recon Battalions. Force recon Marines go through nigh identical training as division recon counterparts, except Force Marines place more heavy emphasis on close combat skills, dynamic assualt tactics, and long range special reconaissance. Their mission differs in that they are more oriented towards conducting longer range intelligence gathering missions, as well as high impact kinetic raids on high value targets with the likely hood of heavy close contact with the enemy. 

#### Divisions

-1st Force Recon Co.
-2nd Force Recon Co.

## Chinese Festivals

<hr>

### Chinese New Year

#### Introduction

  **Chinese New Year**[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-2) is the Chinese festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional [Chinese calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar). The festival is usually referred to as the **Spring Festival** in mainland [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China),[[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-3) and is one of several [Lunar New Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year) in Asia. Observances traditionally take place from the evening preceding the first day of the year to the [Lantern Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern_Festival), held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-4) In 2019, the first day of the Chinese New Year was on **Tuesday, 5 February**, initiating the [Year of the Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac)).

  

#### History

  In 1928, the ruling [Kuomintang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang) party in China decreed that Chinese New Year will fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition from the populace. In 1967 during the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should "Change Customs", have a "revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival", and since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they did not have holidays during Spring Festival day. The public celebrations were reinstated by the time of the [Chinese economic reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform).[[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-54)

  

#### Traditional Food

  A [reunion dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_dinner) (*nián yè fàn*) is held on New Year's Eve during which family members gather for a celebration. The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communal [hot pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot) as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and [Chinese sausage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sausage)) and seafood (e.g. [lobster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster) and [abalone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone)) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (traditional Chinese: 魚; simplified Chinese: 鱼; pinyin: *yú*) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase "may there be *surpluses* every year" (traditional Chinese: 年年有餘; simplified Chinese: 年年有余; pinyin: *niánnián yǒu yú*) sounds the same as "let there be fish every year." 

  

#### Myth & Origin

  Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities) as well as ancestors.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-13)Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#cite_note-14) and the evening preceding Chinese New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual [reunion dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_dinner). It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red [paper-cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_paper_cutting)and [couplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet_(Chinese_poetry)). Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include that of [good fortune or happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_character), wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in [red paper envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelopes). For the northern regions of China, [dumplings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling)are featured prominently in meals celebrating the festival.

### Mid-Autumn Festival

#### Introduction

  The **Mid-Autumn Festival** is a [harvest festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_festival) celebrated notably by the [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese) and [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people) people.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-vietnam-nguyen-3)The festival is held on the **15th day of the 8th month of the [lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar)** with [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon) at night, corresponding to late September to early October of the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) with a full moon at night.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2) [Mooncakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooncake), a rich pastry typically filled with sweet bean paste or lotus seed paste are traditionally eaten during the festival.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-5)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-7)[[8\]]

  

#### History

  The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the [Shang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) (c. 1600–1046 BCE).[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-siu-11) Morris Berkowitz, who studied the [Hakka people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people) during the 1960s, theorizes that the harvest celebration originally began with worshiping mountain deities after the harvest was completed.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-yu-12) For the [Baiyue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue) peoples, the harvest time commemorated the dragon who brought rain for the crops.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-vietnam-nguyen-3) The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty) (618–907 CE).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2) One legend explains that [Emperor Xuanzong of Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang) started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-siu-11) The term *mid-autumn* (中秋) first appeared in *Rites of Zhou*, a written collection of rituals of the [Western Zhou dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Zhou_dynasty) (1046–771 BCE).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-xinhua-2)

  [Empress Dowager Cixi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi) (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival so much that she would spend the period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging elaborate rituals.[[13\]

  

#### Tradional Food

  Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families.[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-18)

  

#### Myth & Origion

  The myths associated with Chang'e explain the origin of moon worship during this day. One version of the story is as follows, as described in Lihui Yang's *Handbook of Chinese Mythology*:[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-handbook-14)

  > In the ancient past, there was a hero named [Hou Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houyi) who was excellent at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Pang Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.

  *Handbook of Chinese Mythology* also describes an alternate common version of the myth:[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival#cite_note-handbook-14)

### Dragon Boat Festival

#### Introduction

  The **Duanwu Festival**, also often known as the **Dragon Boat Festival**, is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the [summer solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice). It is also known as **Zhongxiao Festival** ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 忠孝節; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin): *Zhōngxiàojié*), commemorating [fealty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism#Loyalty)and [filial piety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety). The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional [Chinese calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar), which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the **Double Fifth Festival**.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-1)The Chinese calendar is [lunisolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar), so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). In 2016, it occurred on 9 June; in 2017, on 30 May; and in 2018, on 18 June.

  

#### History

  The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister [Qu Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan) (c. 340–278 BC) of the [ancient state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(Chinese)) of [Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)) during the [Warring States period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period) of the [Zhou Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty).[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10) A cadet member of the [Chu royal house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_(surname)), Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of [Qin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_(state)), Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10) During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry). Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured [Ying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ying_(Chu)), the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the [Miluo River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miluo_River).

  It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of [dragon boat races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat_race). When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of [sticky rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_rice) into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of *zongzi*.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival#cite_note-scmp1-10)

  

#### Traditional Food

  A notable part of celebrating Duanwu is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.

  The reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (中). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as 中奖 (winning a prize).
